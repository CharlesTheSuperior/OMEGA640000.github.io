The Source code for Pringles, an adobe flash game archive website using Ruffle to emulate adobe flash. Mostly just a project for my friends and I. (still a major WIP at this point)

If you want to add games, then go to `/other/sidebar.html`. This contains all of the data for all of the games. It's pretty self explanatory as to what all the things you will have to specify are. Note that flash games do not need the `data-frameheight` and `data-framewidth` attributes. All of the flash game files are stored in a different repo, this can be found at my profile under `ellieeet123/swf`. Just place any game files you want to add in the folder named `swf`
